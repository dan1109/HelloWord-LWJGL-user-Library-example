Eclipse
(you need at least Eclipse Luna (4.4) or Eclipse Kepler (4.3) with the "Eclipse Java 8 Support (for Kepler SR2)" patch installed to work with LWJGL 3 in Eclipse)
Eclipse supports Gradle/Maven projects and it is highly recommended to use them instead of a manual Eclipse project configuration. However, if you prefer setting up a native Eclipse project, follow these instructions (works with Eclipse Neon):

Download the ZIP bundle from https://www.lwjgl.org/customize

When the download is complete, extract its contents to some file system directory, henceforth referred to as <lwjgl3>.

In Eclipse go to menu "Window" > "Preferences" and in the tree view to the left search for 'Java' > 'Build Path' > 'User Libraries'

Click "New..." in the 'User Libraries' dialog. In the opened modal dialog "New User Library" write "LWJGL3" in the 'User library name:' text field and click 'OK'. The newly created library "LWJGL3" should show up in the list 'Defined user libraries:'.

Now, select this item in the list and click 'Add External JARs...'. This opens a standard OS file selection dialog allowing you to select *.jar files which get added to the classpath/buildpath of all projects using the LWJGL3 User Library. Go to <lwjgl3> and select all *.jar files which do not have -javadoc or -sources in their names. Make sure you don't forget the lwjgl-natives-<os>.jar file, and click 'Open'.

This will populate the LWJGL3 user library in the list with respective entries for all selected jar files. You could leave it at that now in order to use LWJGL 3.

However, if you want to have Sources and JavaDocs, you will have to select each of the entries, click on 'Source attachment: (None)' and on 'Edit...'. This will open the "Source Attachment Configuration" dialog. Here you could select 'External location' and 'External File...' to select the appropriate *-sources.jar file.

In order to actually use the LWJGL3 User Library in one of your projects, go to the Build Path settings of your project and select the 'Libraries' tab. Here, click 'Add Library...', select 'User Library' and mark the "LWJGL3" User Library.

Now you are set up to use LWJGL 3 in your project.
